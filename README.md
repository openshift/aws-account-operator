# AWS Account Operator

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/openshift/aws-account-operator/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/openshift/aws-account-operator)

## General Overview

The operator is responsible for creating and maintaining a pool of AWS accounts and assigning accounts to AccountClaims. The operator creates the account in AWS, does initial setup and configuration of the those accounts, creates IAM resources and expose credentials for a IAM user with enough permissions to provision an OpenShift 4.x cluster.

The operator is deployed to an OpenShift cluster in the `aws-account-operator` namespace.

## Build

```shell
make install-tools
make
```

## Quick Start

This Quick Start assumes that you are working on a team that already has AWS Accounts set up for development/testing.  For first time setup, see the prerequisites documentation page.

First, set up your required environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER= # This is set so that it doesn't page out to less and block integration testing
export FORCE_DEV_MODE=local # This flags the operator for local development for some code paths
export OSD_STAGING_1_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID= # Your assigned osd-staging-1 account ID
export OSD_STAGING_2_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID= # Your assigned osd-staging-2 account ID
export OSD_STAGING_1_OU_ROOT_ID= # Your assigned osd-staging-1 OU Root ID
export OSD_STAGING_1_OU_BASE_ID= # Your assigned osd-staging-1 OU Base ID
export STS_ROLE_ARN= # A role you create in your osd-staging-2 account with minimal STS permissions
```

[direnv](https://direnv.net) is what some team members use, and you can add the above block (with variables filled in) into a `.envrc` file (make sure `.envrc` is in your global git ignore as well) and upon entry to the `aws-account-operator` folder the env vars inside the file will be loaded automatically, and unset when you leave the folder.

Next, get your AWS Credentials for the payer account you will be using and export the access key and secret using the following environment variables:

```txt
OPERATOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
OPERATOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

These only need to be set the first time you deploy the operator locally.  Then, run `make predeploy`.

Then, you should be able to run `operator-sdk run --local --namespace aws-account-operator`, and you're up and running.

## Testing

To test that everything's working correctly, we have a set of "acceptance" tests that we've compiled into a single make target:

```shell
make test-all
```

If the everything is set up correctly this should verify that.

## Boilerplate
This repository subscribes to the [openshift/golang-osd-operator](https://github.com/openshift/boilerplate/tree/master/boilerplate/openshift/golang-osd-operator) convention of [boilerplate](https://github.com/openshift/boilerplate/).
See the [README](boilerplate/openshift/golang-osd-operator/README.md) for details about the functionality that brings in.

## Modify the API

Add, delete or modify the files into `pkg/apis/aws/v1alpha1` (excluding the `zz_generated` ones).
Then run:

```shell
./boilerplate/_lib/container-make generate
```
