## 2.2 Account

### 2.2.1 Account CR

The `Account` CR holds the details about the AWS account that was created, where the account is in the process of becoming ready, and whether it is linked to an `AccountClaim`, i.e., claimed.

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Account
metadata:
  name: osd-{accountName}
  namespace: aws-account-operator
spec:
  awsAccountID: "0000000000"
  claimLink: example-link
  iamUserSecret: osd-{accountName}-secret
```

### 2.2.2 Account Controller

The `Account` controller is triggered by creating or changing an `Account` CR. It is responsible for the following behaviors:

If the **awsLimit** set in the constants is not exceeded:

1. Creates a new account in the organization belonging to credentials in secret `aws-account-operator-credentials`
2. Configures two AWS IAM users from `iamUserNameUHC` as their respective username
    - Creates IAM user in new account
    - Attaches Admin policy
    - Generates a secret access key for the user
    - Stores user secret in an AWS secret
3. Creates STS CLI tokens
4. Creates and Destroys EC2 instances
5. Creates AWS support case to increase account limits

**Note:**
* `iamUserNameUHC` is used by Hive to provision clusters

#### Additional Functionality

- If `status.RotateCredentials == true` the account-controller will refresh the STS Cli Credentials.
- If the account's `status.State == "Creating"` and the account is older than the `createPendTime` constant the account will be put into a `failed` state.
- If the account's `status.State == AccountReady && spec.ClaimLink != ""` it sets `status.Claimed = true`.

#### Constants and Globals

```go
iamUserNameUHC          = "osdManagedAdmin"
awsSecretName           = "aws-account-operator-credentials"
awsInstanceType         = "t2.micro"
createPendTime          = 10 * time.Minute

// Fields used to create/monitor AWS case
caseCategoryCode              = "other-account-issues"
caseServiceCode               = "customer-account"
caseIssueType                 = "customer-service"
caseSeverity                  = "high"
caseDesiredInstanceLimit      = 25
caseStatusResolved            = "resolved"
intervalAfterCaseCreationSecs = 30
intervalBetweenChecksSecs     = 30

// AccountPending indicates an account is pending
AccountPending = "Pending"
// AccountCreating indicates an account is being created
AccountCreating = "Creating"
// AccountFailed indicates account creation has failed
AccountFailed = "Failed"
// AccountReady indicates account creation is ready
AccountReady = "Ready"
// AccountPendingVerification indicates verification (of AWS limits and Enterprise Support) is pending
AccountPendingVerification = "PendingVerification"
// IAM Role name for IAM user creating resources in account
accountOperatorIAMRole = "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"

var awsAccountID string
var desiredInstanceType = "m5.xlarge"
var coveredRegions = []string{
    "us-east-1",
    "us-east-2",
    "us-west-1",
    "us-west-2",
    "ca-central-1",
    "eu-central-1",
    "eu-west-1",
    "eu-west-2",
    "eu-west-3",
    "ap-northeast-1",
    "ap-northeast-2",
    "ap-south-1",
    "ap-southeast-1",
    "ap-southeast-2",
    "sa-east-1",
}
```

#### Spec

Updates the Account CR

```yaml
spec:
  awsAccountID: "000000112120"
  claimLink: "claim-name"
  iamUserSecret: accountName-secret
```

* `awsAccountID` is updated with the account ID of the AWS account that is created by the `Account` controller.
* `claimLink` holds the name of the `AccountClaim` that has claimed this `Account` CR.
* `iamUserSecret` holds the name of the secret containing IAM user credentials for the AWS account.

#### Status

Updates the Account CR:

```yaml
status:
  claimed: false
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: 2019-07-18T22:04:38Z
    lastTransitioNTime: 2019-07-18T22:04:38Z
    message: Attempting to create account
    reason: Creating
    status: "True"
    type: Creating
  rotateCredentials: false
  state: Failed
  supportCaseID: "00000000"
```

**state** can be any of the account states defined in the constants below:

- `AccountPending` indicates an account is pending.
- `AccountCreating` indicates an account is being created.
- `AccountFailed` indicates account creation has failed.
- `AccountReady` indicates account creation is ready.
- `AccountPendingVerification` indicates verification (of AWS limits and Enterprise Support) is pending.

* `claimed` is true if `currentAcctInstance.Status.State == AccountReady && currentAcctInstance.Spec.ClaimLink != "`
* `rotateCredentials` updated by the secretwatcher pkg which will set the bool to true triggering an reconcile of this controller to rotate the STS credentials.
* `supportCaseID` is the ID of the aws support case to increase limits
`conditions` indicates the last state the account had and supporting details.
