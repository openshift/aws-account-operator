## 3.4 AWSFederatedRole

### 3.4.1 AWSFederatedRole CR

The `AWSFederatedRole` CR contains a definition of the desired AWS Role, with both managed and custom Policies included

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: AWSFederatedRole
metadata:
  name: example-role
  namespace: aws-account-operator
spec:
  roleDisplayName: Example Role
  roleDescription: This is an example Role
  # Custom Policy definition
  awsCustomPolicy:
    name:  ExampleCustomPolicy
    description: Description of Example Custom Policy
    # list of statements for the policy
    awsStatements:
      - effect: Allow
        action:
        - "aws-portal:ViewAccount"
        - "aws-portal:ViewBilling"
        resource:
        - "*"
  # list of  AWS managed
  awsManagedPolicies:
   - "AWSAccountUsageReportAccess"
   - "AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess"
   - "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
   - "IAMReadOnlyAccess"
```

### 3.4.2 AWSFederatedRole Controller

The `AWSFederatedRole` controller is triggered when an [`AWSFederatedRole`](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/) is created in any namespace. It is responsible for the following behaviors:

1. Building AWS `Policy` Doc from `Role` definition in the spec.
2. Attempting to validate the Role in AWS by creating the `Role`, and deleting it if successful.
3. Setting the status to `Valid` or `Failed`.
4. If the status is `Valid` or `Failed`, stop all reconciling.
5. If an `AWSFederatedRole` is deleted, cleaning up any instances of the Role in AWS by cleaning up any `AWSFederatedAccountAccesses` using the `AWSFederatedRole`.

#### Spec

```yaml
spec:
  roleDisplayName: Example Role
  roleDescription: This is an example Role
  # Custom Policy definition
  awsCustomPolicy:
    name:  ExampleCustomPolicy
    description: Description of Example Custom Policy
    # list of statements for the policy
    awsStatements:
      - effect: Allow
        action:
        - "aws-portal:ViewAccount"
        - "aws-portal:ViewBilling"
        resource:
        - "*"
  # list of  AWS managed
  awsManagedPolicies:
   - "AWSAccountUsageReportAccess"
   - "AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess"## 2.2 Account
   - "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
   - "IAMReadOnlyAccess"
```
* `roleDisplayName` is a human-readable name for the Role.
* `roleDescription` is a human-readable description of what the Role does.
* `awsCustomPolicy` is a representation of an [AWS Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) to be created as part of the Role. It contains a Policy name, a description, and a list of AWS Statements which `Allow` or `Deny` specific actions on specific resources.
* `awsManagedPolicies` is a list of [AWS pre-defined policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) to add to the Role.

#### Status
```yaml
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: {Time Stamp}
    lastTransitionTime: {Time Stamp}
    message: All managed and custom policies are validated
    reason: AllPoliciesValid
    status: "True"
    type: Valid
  state: Valid
```

* `conditions` indicates the last states the `AWSFederatedRole` had and supporting details. In general, for `AWSFederatedRoles`, only one condition is expected, and it should match the state.
* `state` is the current state of the CR. Possible values are `Valid` and `Failed`.
