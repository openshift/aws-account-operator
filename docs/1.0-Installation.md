## 1.1 - Prerequisites
Please ensure you have completed all necessary prerequisite steps before moving onto the Workflow Section below.

[All required prerequisites steps can be found in this section.](1.1-InstallationPrerequisites.md)

Please utilise the [Glossary](0.1-Glossary.md) for any terms or acronyms found in this documentation which you may find unclear. 

## 1.2 Workflow

First, an `AccountPool` must be created to specify the number of desired accounts to be ready. The operator then goes and creates the requested number of accounts.
When a [Hive](https://github.com/openshift/hive) cluster has a new cluster request, an `AccountClaim` is created with the name equal to the desired name of the cluster in a unique workspace.
The operator links the `AccountClaim` to an `Account` CR in the pool, and creates the required k8s secrets, placing them in the `AccountClaim`'s unique namespace.
The `AccountPool` is then filled up again by the operator. Hive then uses the secrets to create the AWS resources for the new cluster.

For more information on how this process is done, please refer to the [Custom Resources and Controllers](2.0-Custom-Resources-and-Controllers.md) page.

## 1.3 Testing your AWS account credentials with the CLI

The commands below can be used to test `Payer Account` credentials where we create new accounts inside the `Payer Account`s organization.
Once the account is created in the first step, we wait until the account is created with step 2 and retrieve its account ID.
Using the account ID we can then test our IAM user has `sts:AssumeRole` permissions to Assume the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the new account.
The `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` is created automatically when a new account is created under the organization.

```
aws organizations create-account --email "username+cli-test@redhat.com" --account-name "username-cli-test" --profile=orgtest

aws organizations list-accounts --profile=orgtest | jq '.[][] | select(.Name=="username-cli-test")'

aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole --role-session-name username-cli-test --profile=orgtest
```
