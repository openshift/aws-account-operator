# 1.0 Installation

## 1.1 - Prerequisites

### 1.1.1 - IAM User and Secret
The operator requires a secret named `aws-account-operator-credentials` in the `aws-account-operator` namespace, containing credentials to the AWS payer account you wish to create accounts in. The secret should contain credentials for an IAM user in the payer account with the data fields `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`.

The user should have the following IAM permissions:

Permissions to allow the user to assume the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` role in any account created:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
       "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
   }
}

```

Permissions to allow the user to interact with the support center:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "support:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

Once the user has been configured, you can deploy the secret by exporting the access key and secret to the following variables and running `make deploy-aws-account-operator-credentials`:

```
OPERATOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
OPERATOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Alternatively, if you have the credentials stored in your `~/.aws/credentials` file, you can use the script in `scripts/set_operator_credentials.sh` to create the secret from that profile: `./scripts/set_operator_credentials.sh my-aws-profile`

### 1.1.2 Config Map

The operator also needs a ConfigMap that has:

Account Limit: The soft limit of AWS Accounts which is the number compared against when creating new accounts
Base: Base OU ID to place accounts in when claimed
Root: Root OU ID to create new OUs under

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "data": {
        "account-limit": "4801",
        "base": "ou-0wd6-tmsbvahq",
        "root": "r-0wd6"
    },
    "kind": "ConfigMap",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "aws-account-operator-configmap",
        "namespace": "aws-account-operator",
    }
}
```

## 1.2 Workflow

First, an AccountPool must be created to specify the number of desired accounts to be ready. The operator then goes and creates that number of accounts.
When a [Hive](https://github.com/openshift/hive) cluster has a new cluster request, an AccountClaim is created with the name equal to the desired name of the cluster in a unique workspace. The operator links the AccountClaim to an Account in the pool, and creates the required k8s secrets, placing them in the AccountClaim's unique namespace. The AccountPool is then filled up again by the operator.  Hive then uses the secrets to create the AWS resources for the new cluster.

For more information on how this process is done, please refer to the controllers section.

## 1.3 Testing your AWS account credentials with the CLI

The below commands can be used to test payer account credentials where we create new accounts inside the payer accounts organization. Once the account is created in the first step we wait until the account is created with step 2 and retrieve its account ID. Using the account ID we can then test our IAM user has sts:AssumeRole permissions to Assume the OrganizationAccountAccessRole in the new account. The OrganizationAccountAccessRole is created automatically when a new account is created under the organization.

1. `aws organizations create-account --email "username+cli-test@redhat.com" --account-name "username-cli-test" --profile=orgtest`
2. `aws organizations list-accounts --profile=orgtest | jq '.[][] | select(.Name=="username-cli-test")'`
3. `aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole --role-session-name username-cli-test --profile=orgtest`

## 1.4 Development

It is recommended to let the operator know when you're running it for testing purposes.
This has benefits such as skipping AWS support case creation.
This is done by setting `FORCE_DEV_MODE` in the operator's environment.
This is handled for you if you use one of the `make deploy-*` targets described below.

## 1.5 Operator Install

The operator can be installed into various cluster and pseudo-cluster environments. Depending which you choose, you can run in "local" mode or in "cluster" mode. The former is known to work in a Minishift or Code-Ready-Containers (CRC) cluster, or a private OpenShift cluster. The latter is known to work in a real OSD cluster. You can try to mix and match; it might work.

Both modes share predeployment steps. These can be done via `make predeploy`, which requires your access key credentials. You must be logged into the cluster as an administrator, or otherwise have permissions to create namespaces and deploy CRDs. For Minishift, this can be done:

```sh
oc login -u system:admin
OPERATOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID" OPERATOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" make predeploy
```

This does the following:
- Ensures existence of the namespace in which the operator will run.
- Installs the [credentials described above](#12-requirements).
- Installs the operator's [Custom Resource Definitions](deploy/crds).
- Creates an initially zero-size [accountpool CR](hack/files/aws_v1alpha1_zero_size_accountpool.yaml).

Predeployment only needs to be done once, unless you are modifying the above artifacts.

### 1.5.1 Local Mode

"Local" development mode differs from production in the following ways:
- AWS support case management is skipped. Your Accounts will get an artificial case number.
- Metrics are served from your local system at http://localhost:8080/metrics

On a local cluster, after [predeploying](#151-operator-install), running

```sh
make deploy-local
```

will invoke the `operator-sdk` executable in `local` mode with the `FORCE_DEV_MODE=local` environment variable.
(**Note:** This currently relies on `operator-sdk` at version 0.5.0. The syntax of the executable has changed over time, so this `make` target may not work with other versions.)

### 1.5.2 Cluster Mode

In "cluster" development mode, as in local mode, AWS support case management is skipped.
However, metrics are served from within the cluster just as they are in a production deployment.

Once logged into the cluster, after [predeploying](#151-operator-install), running

```sh
make deploy-cluster
```

will do the following:
- Create the necessary service accounts, cluster roles, and cluster role bindings.
- Create the operator Deployment, including `FORCE_DEV_MODE=cluster` in the environment of the operator's container.

**Note:** `make deploy-cluster` will deploy the development image created by the `make build` target. As you iterate, you will need to `make build` and `make push` each time before you `make deploy-cluster`.

As with local mode, you must be logged into the cluster as an administrator, or otherwise have permissions to create namespaces and deploy CRDs.
